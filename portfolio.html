    <h1> Project Game #1
    <br>
    <br>This is our Hangman Project that our group did. The code selects words randomly from a preset list with the goal of guessing the correct word before the body of the person is completely drawn. If the player guesses a letter or word incorrectly, then the code draws an additional body part. If the body is completely drawn then the player loses the game.

    <h1> Project Game #2
    <br>
    <br>This is a version of Snake that Aiden and I did. This code can randomize the positions of the pawns and obstacles throughout the entire board and will generate randomly each time a pawn is eaten. The image of Hikaru also changes whenever you die or eat a pawn. Once a pawn is eaten, the score counter goes up and the speed of Hikaru will increase by 20% to make it more challenging.

    <h1> Scratch Game
    <br>
    <br> This is a game that my group made on Scratch. It is a Kraken game where you are supposed to avoid the healthy food that falls from the sky and avoid the Kraken that lurks in the water below. There is a score counter and a high score leaderboard on the start screen where you click the "play" button.

    <h1> PLTW 3.2.4 Honey Production Chart

    <br> This is a graph of Honey Production over years. We made this for a PLTW section where it depicts 50 states and the amount of Honey each state produced in pounds, over years.
